/**
 * <p>
 * Used as the central object to communicate with the jvm MbeanServer.  The MXBean is used to obtain from the
 * MBeanServer in one finite unit the ProcessIO that is used to determine the IO that is used on a KB per
 * second ratio.  Without the MXBean we would have to obtain from the jmx server the individual values for the
 * ProcessIO object.  Such as the amount of IO currently used, and the amount of IO previously used.  If we had to
 * do this we'd have to obtain the values independently from each other, and as a result this risks having
 * the values update inbetween fetching the values.  As a result the MXBean, allows for the retrieval of the
 * ProcessIO object as a unique self contained unit.  Therefore, the previous value is related to the current value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The MXBean returns:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The amount of KB or MB per second that has occurred since that last time the process IO was read</li>
 *     <li>The amoutn of KB or MB, per second, that the process has resulted in.</li>
 * </ul>
